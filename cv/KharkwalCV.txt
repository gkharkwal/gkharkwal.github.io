RELEVANT PROJECTS:
Syntactic Complexity as a Feature for Automatic Essay Scoring --- Course Project, Spring '13 
  * Evaluated syntactic complexity as a feature for automated essay scoring using 12,000 essays.
  * Quantified syntactic complexity as processing difficulty during reading with a psycholinguistic model called "surprisal".
  * Obtained processing complexity per word for every essay using a parser trained on WSJ corpus.
  * Extracted and organized data using Python, and analyzed them by performing correlation tests and building classification models on R.
  * Found significant inverse correlation indicating simpler sentences are linked with better essay scores.
 
Improving Mood Estimates for Stock Market Prediction --- Course Project, Spring '12
  * Obtained public mood estimates as time series data using a 7-month collection of tweets.
  * Enhanced mood estimates by weighting tweets with user influence and topic relevance information.
  * Parsed tweets corpus and developed topic models using Python.
  * Conducted model-testing using Matlab to evaluate predictive capabilities of enhanced estimates.
  * Improved regression models of stock market trends by 30% with user-influence and topic-relevance enhancements.
  
Ontology-based Semantic Parsing --- MS in CS, 2012 – 2013
  * Created a semantic parser using a constraint-based grammatical framework to produce ontological meaning representations for given sentences.
  * Developed an NLTK-inspired grammar module and a bottom-up chart parser in Python.
  * Compared parser with an equivalent CFG parser by collecting performance statistics and analyzing them via linear mixed-effects regression models.
  * Code available at: github.com/gkharkwal/LWFGParser
   
Human Sentence Processing with Word-level Noise --- PhD in Cog Psych, 2011 - ongoing
  * Investigated how people comprehend sentences containing unknown words.
  * Developed web-based and offline experiments from scratch using Python, PHP, and Java.
  * Cleaned and analyzed data using Python, R, and Matlab.
  * Developed Bayesian models of sentence processing that integrated noisy word recognition by performing corpus analysis on large-scale textual data.
 
Linguistic Representations of Visual Events --- MS in Cog Psych, 2009 - 2011
  * Evaluated two theories of human language comprehension by developing a new experimental paradigm.
  * Used Python to create experimental stimuli from scratch and to collect and parse data.
  * Analyzed data with traditional and Bayesian techniques using R and Matlab.
